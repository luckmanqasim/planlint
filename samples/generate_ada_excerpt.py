"""Generate the bundled codebook: an excerpt of the 2010 ADA Standards for
Accessible Design (a US-government work, public domain — safe to bundle,
unlike NFPA/ICC codebooks).

Headings are set in bold like a real codebook so layout-aware parsers
(Docling) classify them as section headers; each clause body is its own
paragraph so the simple parser recovers the tree too.

Run:  uv run --project ../backend python generate_ada_excerpt.py
